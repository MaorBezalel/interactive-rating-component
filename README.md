# Frontend Mentor - Interactive Rating Component Solution

This project, the "Interactive Rating Component," was created as a frontend practice exercise to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
The idea behind this project came from a challenge provided by Frontend Mentor, a platform that offers design challenges to improve frontend development skills.<br>
Through this challenge, I aimed to build a visually engaging and user-friendly rating component that allows users to provide feedback on a service.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## Process

### Description

The "Interactive Rating Component" is a simple frontend project that enables users to rate a service on a scale of 1 to 5.<br>
The project consists of two main sections: the "Rating" state and the "Thank You" state.<br>
In the "Rating" state, users can click on the rating points to select their desired rating, and the chosen rating is visually highlighted.<br>
After clicking the "Submit" button, the component transitions to the "Thank You" state, displaying the selected rating and expressing gratitude to the user.

**The project was developed using semantic HTML5 for the structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity.**

### Key Features

- **Interactive Rating**: Users can click on the rating points to select their desired rating from 1 to 5.
- **Visual Feedback**: The selected rating point is highlighted with an orange background and white text.
- **Responsive Design**: The rating component is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **Thank You Message**: After submitting a rating, users are presented with a "Thank You" message that displays their chosen rating.
